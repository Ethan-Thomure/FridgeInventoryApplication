# Fridge Inventory Application
This was a college final project.
The application contains a database filled with items representing a fridge's contents, it has:

- a name
- expiration date
- units

The operations on this list provided by the GUI are:

- Add New Items
- Create Alarm
- Update Contents
- Delete
  
For the alarm, when it "goes off" by seeing that the amount of units in the fridge is less than what it has been set to, it adds the amount of those items it needs in the "Grocery List"

# Installation
clone the repository

# Usage
This was all made via Visual Studio 2022, which is a pretty good way to get the program to work.
